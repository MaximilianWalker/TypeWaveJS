## Introduction

TypeWave JS is a versatile collection of standalone libraries, each uniquely designed to create sophisticated typing animations seamlessly across different web technologies without interdependencies. This advanced tool is optimized for specific environments, ensuring optimal performance and integration. Whether you are developing in vanilla JavaScript or React, TypeWave JS enables developers to craft everything from simple typing effects to complex animated sequences. This includes controlling typing speed, cursor movements, text deletions, pauses within sequences, continuous loops, and dynamic configuration changes during an animation, providing a specialized, tailor-made solution for your project's needs.


## Features

- **Dynamic Typing**: Simulates typing with adjustable speed, cursor movements, and deletions.
- **Customizable Cursor**: Options to show or hide the cursor and customize its character.
- **Event Control**: Manipulates typing behavior through a structured event system.
- **Animation Control**: Offers fine control over each stage of the animation, including pauses and loops.
- **Versatility**: Accepts React elements as inputs, allowing for a wide range of use cases.
